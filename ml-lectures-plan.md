# Outline for ML lectures March 23 & 25

* Definition of Machine Learning
  * Relationship to statistics, informatics, data science
* The most common machine learning tasks
  * Classification
  * Regression
  * Clustering
* Supervised / unsupervised / other
* Logistic Regression
  * Examples in practice
  * Overview of LR
  * Mathematical notation, functions
  * LR as an optimization problem (+ intro to optimization)
  * Regularization - why and how
* Neural networks
  * LR as a neural network
  * The structure of a neural network
  * A neural network as an optimization problem
  * Examples in practice
* Decision trees
  * Learning a tree
  * Random forests & boosted methods (high-level)
* Training and testing (vs fitting in statistics?)
  * Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, ROC)
  * Division of data into training, testing, validation
  * Cross-validation
* ML for non-tabular data (high-level)
  * RNN
  * CNN
  * Examples
* Clustering, imputation, recommender systems
  * K-means
  * Hierarchical
  * Neighbor embeddings (abstractly)
  * Topic model / Matrix factorization (abstractly)
  * Examples

Need a few good motivating applications to build around.
